# Project Code Requirements

## MVC

The project implements the Model-View-Controller pattern.

- Models are in the `app/Models` directory.
- Controllers are in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.
- Views are in the `resources/js/Pages` directory.

## Design Patterns



## OOP

The project is object-oriented by design thanks to laravel but most of the UI is functional.
